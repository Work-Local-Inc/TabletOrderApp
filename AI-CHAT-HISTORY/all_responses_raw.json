    "textDescription": "ok repeat with me...process gets stucks everytime the only time it has worked has been when you downloaded and used the gradle exstention. thats all i know becuase i didnt do it so i dont have the memory of \"how it was used\" i just know you downloaded.. then asked me to instal (click a button) and that was that/. we need t find a way to use it. can you access context7 gradle docs maybe there could be somethig help full in that? he have to find a way to try without getting stuck or if we do have a way to know we are stuck you dotn seem to have this capability and if i cant see output then im no help either. \n\n\n\nThis here is from Cursor - Here's how Cursor and Gradle interact:\n\nDependency Management: Cursor can assist in managing build.gradle files by suggesting and adding necessary dependencies, potentially reducing the need for manual searching.\n\nBuild Automation: Cursor can understand and interact with Gradle commands, such as ./gradlew build or ./gradlew run, to execute build tasks, compile code, and run applications.\n\nAI-Assisted Code Generation and Modification: When working on projects that use Gradle, Cursor's AI agent can be prompted to generate or modify code, including build scripts or configurations within build.gradle files, based on natural language instructions.\n\nTroubleshooting and Optimization: Cursor can help analyze Gradle-related issues, such as dependency conflicts or build errors, and potentially suggest solutions or optimizations to improve build performance.\n\nLanguage Server Integration: Cursor aims to integrate with Gradle language servers to provide features like autocompletion and error checking within build.gradle files, although issues with language server detection can sometimes occur and require configuration adjustments (e.g., ensuring correct JAVA_HOME environment variable settings).\n\n\n\n##ok discovery###\n\ndid some research specifically on the exstension we are using and found this.. I installed the patch listd here :) \"Describe the Bug\n\nCursor cannot be used (fully) with Gradle 9 projects because the vscode-gradle extension is too out-of-date. In Cursor I see latest (as of today) as 3.15.0 (Feb 2024), but the actual most recent release of that extension is 3.16.4 (June 2025).\n\nThe vscode extension has fixed their issue with gradle 9. That fix didn\u2019t make it into their existing 3.17.0 pre-release, but hopefully will still be released relatively soon. See: Gradle for Java plugin breaks with Gradle 9 projects \u00b7 Issue #1686 \u00b7 microsoft/vscode-gradle \u00b7 GitHub\n\nWhy is the version of the vscode-gradle plugin in the Cursor extension marketplace more than a year old?\n\nSteps to Reproduce\n\nTry to use Cursor on any project build with Gradle 9.0.0 using the \u201cGradle for Java\u201d (microsoft/vscode-gradle) extension.\n\nExpected Behavior\n\nCursor should work on Gradle 9 projects just as well as is does with Gradle 8.14 projects. Cursor\u2019s extension marketplace should get new releases of the vscode-gradle plugin much faster than with >1yr delay.\n\nOperating System\n\nWindows 10/11\n\nCurrent Cursor Version (Menu \u2192 About Cursor \u2192 Copy)\n\nCursor Version: 1.3.9\n\nVSCode Version: 1.99.3\n\nDoes this stop you from using Cursor\n\nYes - Cursor is unusable\n\n304\n\nviews\n\n5\n\nlinks\n\npost by snjeza on Aug 7\n\nSnjezana Peco\n\nsnjeza\n\nAug 7\n\nCursor uses Open VSX Registry - Open VSX Registry\n\nMicrosoft hasn\u2019t published newer versions of Gradle For Java and pre-release versions na Open VSX Registry\n\nI have created VSIX using the latest Gradle For Java develop branch - https://github.com/snjeza/vscode-test/raw/refs/heads/master/vscode-gradle-3.17.6.vsix\n\nYou can install it with View>Command Palette>Extensions: Install from VSIX\u2026\n\nThe extension requires Language Support for Java\u2122 by Red Hat pre-release. It is on Open VSX registry so it can be installed from Cursor.\n\nAfter that, you can try to import a Gradle 9 project.\""
