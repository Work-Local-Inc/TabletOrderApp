    "text": "##CODEX AGENT AUDIT REPORT##\n\nHere are the key risks and fixes I see in the current \u201cworking\u201d build:\n\n\n\nNew Architecture still enabled (android/gradle.properties: newArchEnabled=true). This was the root cause of the async-storage CMake/codegen failures earlier. If the Gradle plugin workaround is removed or you clean the project, builds can break again.\n\nFix: set newArchEnabled=false in android/gradle.properties and keep it there.\n\n\n\nAndroid SDK path keeps breaking builds. Even though android/local.properties has sdk.dir=/Users/brianlapp/Library/Android/sdk, Gradle has failed with \u201cSDK location not found.\u201d The only reliable fix is exporting ANDROID_HOME and ANDROID_SDK_ROOT in your build command/CI:\n\n\n\nANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk\n\nANDROID_SDK_ROOT=~/Library/Android/sdk\n\nKeep using --no-interactive to avoid plugin prompts.\n\n\n\nPatches live in node_modules and will be lost on npm install. We patched Expo Android modules (barcode-scanner/image-loader) and settings.gradle to build with SDK 36. Those edits sit in node_modules and android/settings.gradle; a clean install or expo prebuild will revert them.\n\nFix: capture these changes with patch-package or commit the patched android/node_modules files to your repo so they survive reinstalls.\n\n\n\nPrinter dependency mismatch risk. react-native-thermal-receipt-printer-image-qr pulls react-native-ping with a peer range up to RN 0.70; you\u2019re on RN 0.81. It builds now, but be aware this is outside the library\u2019s stated support. If you see runtime issues, consider a maintained ESC/POS library or pinning to a vetted fork.\n\n\n\nBase URL hardcoded. src/api/client.ts falls back to https://39d6a4b9-a0f2-4544-a607-a9203b1fa6a8-00-1qkpr2vwm16p5.riker.replit.dev unless EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL is set. Make sure your build pipeline sets this env var per environment so you don\u2019t ship a build pointing to the wrong backend.\n\n\n\nSupabase service-role warning. src/lib/supabase.ts still references the old URL and a removed key with a warning. Since you\u2019re using REST now, leave it unused and ensure the old service role key is revoked in Supabase.\n\n\n\nAPK size/ABI targets. reactNativeArchitectures includes all ABIs (arm/x86). For your shipped tablet builds, limit to armeabi-v7a,arm64-v8a to reduce size and build time.\n\n\n\nIf you want, I can: (1) flip newArchEnabled=false, (2) add patch-package entries for the Expo module fixes/settings.gradle so they persist, and (3) tighten the build script with the required SDK env vars.",

    "text": "NO NO NO NO DELETE THE SIMPLE UI WE HAD THE NEW ONE WORKIGN THAtS THE ONE WE ARE WORKIGN ON I DONT GIVE A FLYING FUCK ABOUT THE SIMPLE UI BRO!!!!!!! WE ARE BUILDING THE NEW UI IT WAS WORKING AND WE ARE continuing the build! im not suing the app right now I dotn have a need to JUST GET IT WORKING we are building for the sake of perfection common, dude stop reverting to the simple UI we knowwe can from from location A to the tablet to the printer now we ar emakign the app actually usefull you implimented every thing it EWAS WORKING all you did was add a logo and a new color theme. it shoudl not be so broken that you need to trash it!!! fuck \n\n\n\nHeres the latest audit report if it helps you:\n\nHere\u2019s a detailed audit of the current Square-style build across UI, behavior, and build system (no changes made):\n\n\n\nOverall\n\n\n\nApp is feature-complete: REST client with token refresh, Zustand store with merge/sort/offline queue, full Square-like orders UI (list + detail pane), printing service, settings, heartbeat/network hooks.\n\nPrimary fragility is in the Android build setup (new architecture flag, module patches persistence, SDK envs). Secondary gaps are UX polish (printer connect/test, sound asset, QR wiring) and env/config hygiene.\n\nBuild/Config\n\n\n\nnew architecture: android/gradle.properties still has newArchEnabled=true. Earlier failures came from this. Unless the Gradle plugin you\u2019re using enforces a workaround, a clean build/CI may break. Safer to set newArchEnabled=false unless you need Fabric/TurboModules.\n\nSDK paths: Even with android/local.properties, AGP has failed with \u201cSDK not found\u201d. Keep ANDROID_HOME and ANDROID_SDK_ROOT set to /Users/brianlapp/Library/Android/sdk in build scripts/CI.\n\nPatches persistence: Expo Android modules (barcode-scanner/image-loader) and settings.gradle were patched to work with AGP 8 / SDK 36. If these are only in node_modules, a fresh install/prebuild will revert them. Use patch-package or commit patched files to avoid regressions.\n\nABI targets: reactNativeArchitectures includes x86/x86_64. For tablet deployment, limit to armeabi-v7a,arm64-v8a to shrink APKs and speed builds.\n\nAPI base URL: src/api/client.ts falls back to https://39d6a4b9-a0f2-4544-a607-a9203b1fa6a8-00-1qkpr2vwm16p5.riker.replit.dev unless EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL is set. Ensure build pipelines set this per environment.\n\nSupabase: src/lib/supabase.ts is deprecated; key removed. Confirm the old service-role key is revoked in Supabase.\n\nUI/UX (Square-like layout)\n\n\n\nOrders screen: Two-pane layout with filters, list, detail; header shows restaurant, printer, online status; printer warning CTA is good.\n\nComponents (OrderListItem, OrderDetailPanel, OrderFilters, StatusBadge) are well-styled and informative.\n\nMissing/weak spots:\n\nQR scan: Ensure the Login QR button is wired to expo-barcode-scanner with permission flow; if not needed, hide it.\n\nPrinter UX: Settings still needs discover/connect/test UI wired to printService (currently only status + warning). Add scan/connect/test actions and reflect printerConnected/printerName from store.\n\nNotifications: useOrderNotifications vibrates; sound toggle depends on a missing mp3 and expo-av. Either bundle a sound asset or hide the sound option.\n\nTest creds: Login defaults to TEST_UUID/TEST_KEY under DEV; verify they\u2019re not bundled in prod.\n\nTheme: ThemeProvider is present, but styles are mostly hardcoded dark palette; if light/dark switching matters, align styles to theme.\n\nPrinting\n\n\n\nprintService.ts is robust: ESC/POS formatting, kitchen/receipt/both, printed-state tracking in Orders screen. Library (react-native-thermal-receipt-printer-image-qr) depends on react-native-ping targeting RN \u22640.70; you\u2019re on 0.81. It builds now; monitor runtime on devices. If issues appear, consider a maintained ESC/POS alternative.\n\nData/State/API\n\n\n\nREST client solid: Axios with interceptors, token refresh, env override for BASE_URL.\n\nStore solid: Merge/sort, offline queue, polling, settings persisted. Printed-state is tracked via AsyncStorage.\n\nPerformance/Stability\n\n\n\nPolling every 5s is fine; could add adaptive backoff when idle/offline.\n\nAPK size/build time can be improved by limiting ABIs.\n\nNew architecture off = more predictable builds.\n\nSecurity\n\n\n\nSupabase service-role key removed; ensure revoked.\n\nAvoid shipping test creds; ensure env is set for backend.\n\nRecommendations (actionable)\n\n\n\nFor stable builds: set newArchEnabled=false; enforce ANDROID_HOME/ANDROID_SDK_ROOT; persist module patches (patch-package or commit) for Expo Android modules/settings.gradle; limit ABIs to arm only.\n\nUX polish: Wire printer discover/connect/test in Settings to printService; verify QR scanning wiring or hide the button; bundle a notification sound or hide the toggle.\n\nConfig: Ensure EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL is set in all builds; remove/gate test creds for prod.\n\nMonitor printer library compatibility on real devices; if unstable, switch to a maintained ESC/POS lib.\n\nThis is a strong build overall; main risks are build reproducibility and a few UX gaps around printer connection/notifications.",

You can use this interface to view Gradle Tasks and Project dependencies, or run Gradle Tasks as VS Code Task. The extension also offers better Gradle file (e.g. build.gradle) authoring experience including syntax highlighting, error reporting and auto completion. The extension works nicely alongside other Java extensions in the Extension Pack for Java.\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\nVS Code >= 1.76.0\n\nJava from 8 to 21\n\nProject Discovery\n\nThis extension supports both root and nested Gradle projects. A Gradle project is identified by having Gradle Wrapper scripts (gradlew or gradlew.bat) or Gradle build files (build.gradle or settings.gradle and their Kotlin versions) at the root of a directory. (Nested Gradle project discovery is not enabled by default, set \"gradle.nestedProjects\": true to enable it.)\n\n\n\nFeature Overview\n\nOnce the extension is activated you will see a new Gradle icon in the activity bar. Clicking on this icon will reveal some tree views in the sidebar.\n\n\n\nProtip: you can move drag & drop any of these tree views into the main explorer view for easier access. This is especially useful for pinned tasks.\n\n\n\nYou can also run any Gradle task as a VS Code task. Access the Gradle VS Code tasks by running Run Task from the command palette.\n\n\n\nList projects and tasks\n\nList project dependencies\n\nRun tasks\n\nControl task terminal behaviour\n\nDebug tasks\n\nPin tasks\n\nList recent tasks\n\nList & kill Gradle daemons\n\nSyntax highlighting for Gradle files\n\nDocument outline for Gradle files\n\nError reporting for Gradle files\n\nAuto completion for Gradle files\n\nFull features list\n\nExtension Settings\n\nThis extension contributes the following settings:\n\n\n\ngradle.autoDetect: Automatically detect Gradle tasks (\"on\" or \"off\")\n\ngradle.focusTaskInExplorer: Focus the task in the explorer when running a task (boolean)\n\ngradle.nestedProjects: Process nested projects (boolean or an array of directories)\n\ngradle.reuseTerminals: Reuse task terminals (\"task\" [default], \"all\", or \"off\")\n\ngradle.javaDebug.cleanOutput: Clean the task output cache before debugging (boolean)\n\ngradle.debug: Show extra debug info in the output panel (boolean)\n\ngradle.disableConfirmations: Disable the warning confirm messages when performing batch actions (eg clear tasks, stop daemons etc) (boolean)\n\ngradle.allowParallelRun: Allow to run tasks in parallel, each running will create a new terminal. This configuration will override gradle.reuseTerminals and always create new task terminals when running or debugging a task.\n\ngradle.projectOpenBehaviour: Specify the default method of opening newly created project (\"Interactive\", \"Open\" or \"Add to Workspace\")\n\njava.gradle.buildServer.enabled: Whether to use build server to synchronize Gradle project (\"on\" or \"off\")\n\njava.gradle.buildServer.openBuildOutput: Controls when the build output should open (\"neverOpen\", \"openOnBuildStart\" or \"openOnBuildFailure\")\n\nGradle & Java Settings\n\nSet Gradle & Java options with standard environment variables or standard Gradle settings (eg via gradle.properties or task configuration).\n\n\n\nExample Environment Variables\n\nJAVA_HOME\n\nGRADLE_USER_HOME\n\nNote, the VS Code settings take precedence over the environment variables.\n\n\n\nUse an environment manager like direnv to set project specific environment variables\n\n\n\nCompatibility with the Java language support extension\n\nJava-Specific Settings\n\nThis extension supports the following settings which are contributed by the Java language support extension:\n\n\n\njava.home: (deprecated Please use java.jdt.ls.java.home as given below) Absolute path to JDK home folder used to launch the Gradle daemons\n\n\n\njava.jdt.ls.java.home: Absolute path to JDK home folder as per the latest VS code, used to launch the Gradle daemons\n\n\n\njava.import.gradle.java.home: Absolute path to JDK home folder used to launch the Gradle daemons (if set, this value takes precedence over java.home)\n\n\n\njava.import.gradle.user.home: Setting for GRADLE_USER_HOME\n\n\n\njava.import.gradle.jvmArguments: JVM arguments to pass to Gradle\n\n\n\nNote: There should be a space between two arguments\n\n\n\njava.import.gradle.wrapper.enabled: Enable/disable the Gradle wrapper\n\n\n\njava.import.gradle.version: Gradle version, used if the Gradle wrapper is missing or disabled\n\n\n\njava.import.gradle.home: Use Gradle from the specified local installation directory or GRADLE_HOME if the Gradle wrapper is missing or disabled and no 'java.import.gradle.version' is specified.\n\n\n\nClass References\n\nThere are cases where Gradle tasks will generate Java classes. To ensure these Java classes are indexed correctly by the Java language server, you need to ensure the paths are added to the .classpath, and this is typically achieved using Gradle sourceSets.\n\n\n\nOnce you've configured your sourceSets correctly, follow these steps:\n\n\n\nGenerate your classes by running the relevant Gradle Task\n\nForce the Language Server to index the generated classes by right-clicking on build.gradle and selecting Update project configuration.\n\nAt this point the Gradle sourceSet paths will be added to the .classpath and the Language Server will automatically update references when those classes change.\n\n\n\nExtension API\n\nThis extension provides an API which can be used by 3rd-party vscode extensions.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Extension API\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nView logs by selecting \"Gradle Tasks\" in the output panel\n\nSet the \"gradle.debug\" setting to \"true\" to view debug logs in the output panel\n\nTask output will be shown in the Terminal panel\n\nTask output is truncated\n\n\"No connection to the gradle server. Try restarting the server\"\n\nIssues with environment vars\n\n\"Orphaned\" Java processes after quitting VS Code\n\nIncompatibility with other extensions\n\nSupport\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Submit a bug report\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Submit a feature request\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Submit any feedback\n\nData/Telemetry\n\nVS Code collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve our products and services.

I installed the patch listd here :) \"Describe the Bug\n\nCursor cannot be used (fully) with Gradle 9 projects because the vscode-gradle extension is too out-of-date. In Cursor I see latest (as of today) as 3.15.0 (Feb 2024), but the actual most recent release of that extension is 3.16.4 (June 2025).\n\nThe vscode extension has fixed their issue with gradle 9. That fix didn\u2019t make it into their existing 3.17.0 pre-release, but hopefully will still be released relatively soon. See: Gradle for Java plugin breaks with Gradle 9 projects \u00b7 Issue #1686 \u00b7 microsoft/vscode-gradle \u00b7 GitHub\n\nWhy is the version of the vscode-gradle plugin in the Cursor extension marketplace more than a year old?\n\nSteps to Reproduce\n\nTry to use Cursor on any project build with Gradle 9.0.0 using the \u201cGradle for Java\u201d (microsoft/vscode-gradle) extension.\n\nExpected Behavior\n\nCursor should work on Gradle 9 projects just as well as is does with Gradle 8.14 projects. Cursor\u2019s extension marketplace should get new releases of the vscode-gradle plugin much faster than with >1yr delay.\n\nOperating System\n\nWindows 10/11\n\nCurrent Cursor Version (Menu \u2192 About Cursor \u2192 Copy)\n\nCursor Version: 1.3.9\n\nVSCode Version: 1.99.3\n\nDoes this stop you from using Cursor\n\nYes - Cursor is unusable\n\n304\n\nviews\n\n5\n\nlinks\n\npost by snjeza on Aug 7\n\nSnjezana Peco\n\nsnjeza\n\nAug 7\n\nCursor uses Open VSX Registry - Open VSX Registry\n\nMicrosoft hasn\u2019t published newer versions of Gradle For Java and pre-release versions na Open VSX Registry\n\nI have created VSIX using the latest Gradle For Java develop branch - https://github.com/snjeza/vscode-test/raw/refs/heads/master/vscode-gradle-3.17.6.vsix\n\nYou can install it with View>Command Palette>Extensions: Install from VSIX\u2026\n\nThe extension requires Language Support for Java\u2122 by Red Hat pre-release. It is on Open VSX registry so it can be installed from Cursor.\n\nAfter that, you can try to import a Gradle 9 project.\"",
